# VCFinderDemo
This is a small demo of a larger project which I completed in my time at Joyance Partners. In order to maintain privacy, a redacted portion of the code is here.

One of the key files missing is db.php which acted as the credentials for connecting to our server and its databases. 
Another one of the files missing is display_results.js which provided the recomendation methodology.
